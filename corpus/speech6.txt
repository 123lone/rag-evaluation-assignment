Ambedkar examined the origin of the Shudras and argued that they were originally a powerful Kshatriya community. Over time, they were socially degraded due to conflicts with the Brahmins. He identified them as “broken men,” people without land or status because of historical injustice.

He explains that the Shudras later became victims of social exclusion and were denied access to education and power. Ambedkar believed that restoring dignity to the oppressed required rejecting discriminatory traditions and adopting modern, rational values. He states that social progress depends on equality and justice for all.
