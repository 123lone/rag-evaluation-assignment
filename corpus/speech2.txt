Buddha rejected the authority of the Vedas and condemned ritualistic practices that offered no moral value. Dr. Ambedkar explains that the Buddha’s teaching emphasized reason, compassion, and the removal of suffering. The Buddha taught that the true religion must be based on morality, not rituals.

Ambedkar further states that the Buddha opposed inequality and the caste system. He believed in the dignity of every individual and promoted a social order based on equality. The Dhamma encourages right conduct, right thought, and right livelihood. It rejects blind faith and emphasizes knowledge and understanding.
