Ambedkar explains that the Constitution provides individuals with Fundamental Rights which protect their freedom and dignity. He identifies two types of constitutional remedies: preventive remedies and corrective remedies. Preventive remedies stop the violation of rights before it occurs, while corrective remedies address violations after they happen.

He emphasizes that the right to constitutional remedies is the heart and soul of the Constitution. Ambedkar argues that political democracy cannot survive without social democracy. Rights must not only be guaranteed on paper but also accessible in practice. He warns that without public participation, rights lose their meaning.
