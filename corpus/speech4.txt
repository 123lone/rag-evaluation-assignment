Ambedkar describes the deeply humiliating experiences he faced as a child due to untouchability. He narrates how he was denied water, transportation, and entry into public places simply because of his caste. His childhood was marked by social exclusion, discrimination, and humiliation.

He explains that untouchability is not merely a social evil but a psychological torture imposed on millions. Ambedkar believed that unless untouchability is uprooted, equality and justice cannot be achieved. He held that education is the most powerful tool to break the chains of caste and untouchability.
