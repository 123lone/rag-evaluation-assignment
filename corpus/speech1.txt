The caste system in India is a system of graded inequality. It divides the population into distinct classes, each considered superior or inferior by birth. According to Dr. Ambedkar, caste destroys the concept of brotherhood and unity. He argues that caste is deeply rooted in Hindu religious scriptures, and therefore, the real solution must come from a rejection of the scriptures that support caste.

Ambedkar states that social reform is impossible as long as caste remains. He argues that political reform alone cannot succeed unless social reform comes first. He criticizes Gandhi’s defense of Varnashrama and states that caste is not just a division of labor, but a division of laborers. He concludes that real freedom requires the destruction of caste in all forms.
