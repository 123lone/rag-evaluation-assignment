Ambedkar argued that the creation of Pakistan was inevitable due to the deep and historical differences between Hindus and Muslims. He believed that the two communities had distinct social customs, religious beliefs, and political aspirations that made unity difficult.

He explained that forcing Muslims and Hindus into a single nation would only create instability and conflict. According to Ambedkar, a peaceful separation was better than a forced union. He also stated that political safeguards alone could not bridge the gap; therefore, partition was a practical solution.
